              <p>
                I am a data scientist specializing in machine learning, statistical analysis, causal inference, and AI implementation.<br /><br /> 
                Here are my key strengths: 
                  <ul> 
                    <li><strong>Perseverance</strong>Developed a analytical method to minimize bias and accurately measure the true impact of marketing campaigns, especially useful in situations where campaign effectiveness verification was not initially planned for measurement. This meticulous analysis clarified previously underestimated effectiveness of campaign, facilitating informed decision-making for campaign implementations.</li> 
                    <li><strong>Strong curiosity and enthusiasm for technology</strong>Continuously exploring and embracing new technologies, with a particular passion for applying cutting-edge innovations to practical business challenges. You can see my curiosity about technologies on <a href="https://qiita.com/icchi-ioo">here</a></li> 
                    <li><strong>Fast learning ability</strong>Quickly mastered basic theory of image generation AI ("Diffusion Model") despite no prior experience by myself. Within a short period, I transitioned from fundamental theories to practical applications, generating high-quality image, usable banner images. Beyond image generation, I successfully developed workflows to deliver segmented banners tailored to specific target audiences (divided into age and sex). I think this is the best example which is appeared my strength</li> 
                    <li><strong>Effective communication with clients</strong>Successfully improved the Click-Through Rate (CTR) of an email campaign --Supplement : CTR Improvement: Initial 0.25% (target KPI: 0.5%) → 1.09% (after basic analysis) → 1.31% (after ML implementation)-- by first carefully confirming client constraints and clearly aligning expectations. Leveraged internal data for analysis, presenting insights in an intuitive format easily understood by the client. After confirming initial improvements, gained the client's trust and proposed advanced machine learning solutions. Subsequently implemented a CTR prediction model, resulting in further improvements. Integrated bias-removal strategies into the campaign's long-term operational framework, continually aligning with the client's goals through consistent and effective communication.</li>

              Banner Generation using Image Generation AI (Aug 2024 ~ Present)
            </h4>
            <p>
              Engaged in an advertising banner generation project utilizing the
              AI image generation model "Stable Diffusion" and "FLUX".
              <br /><br />
              At the beginning of the project, I had no prior knowledge of AI
              image generation, but I proactively acquired expertise in
              fundamental theories, the latest technologies and their
              applications, then, successfully generating high-quality banner
              images.
              <br /><br />
              Additionally, I have constructed workflows to generate personalized, optimized images tailored specifically to target audiences, and successfully delivered them through social media platforms. In this project, I was able to fully leverage my strengths,
              including a strong interest in technology, a fast learning
              ability, and a proactive approach to tackling challenging issues.

              Effectiveness Verification and Analysis to Support Campaign Decision-making (May 2024 ~ Aug 2024)
            </h4>
            <p>
              Worked on projects to verify the effectiveness of various marketing campaigns, supporting decision-making processes regarding whether to implement campaigns distributing reward points to users who complete fee simulations.
              <br/><br/>

              In particular, measured the contribution of fee simulation webpages in order to evaluate futuristic campaign impact, even in cases where effectiveness evaluation had not been planned during webpage creation.
              <br/><br/>

              To address this challenge, I developed an analytical method combining logistic regression with inverse probability weighting (IPW), minimizing bias and accurately measuring the true effectiveness of doing fee simulation. As a result, I successfully corrected previously underestimated effectiveness of fee simulation page through detailed analysis, enabling informed decision-making and supporting the implementation of campaigns to distribute reward points effectively.

              Marketing List Optimization using Prediction Models (Mar 2023 ~ Aug 2024)
            </h4>
            <p>
              Client requests often come with underlying challenges. I am capable of managing the entire process comprehensively—from requirement definition and strategic proposal to effectiveness verification and reporting.
              <br/><br/>

              For example, in a project aimed at improving email DM click-through rates (CTR), the client sought to identify reasons behind low conversion rates. I first performed a basic aggregated analysis and documented the root causes clearly in a report. After confirming an improvement in CTR based on the insights derived from my analysis, I proceeded to develop a predictive model for CTR, using it to further refine the selection criteria for the DM recipient list. Moreover, keeping long-term operations and effectiveness verification in mind, I proactively incorporated a bias-removal mechanism into the strategy, closely aligning with the client through continuous discussions and mutual agreement.
              <br/><br/>

              CTR Improvement Results:
              <br/>
              Initial CTR: 0.25% (Target KPI: 0.5%)
              <br/>
              → After basic analysis: 1.09%
              <br/>
              → After implementing ML model: 1.31%
